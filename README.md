# Basic-Neural-Network

This project is a basic neural network written from scratch in c++. I developed this to learn c++ and understand machine learning.

The NeuralNetwork class constructor takes in a learning rate, layer count, and nodes per layer array as parameters making it scalable and suitable for many basic machine learning applications. 

This model can be trained on many types of data, but for simplicity, I generated training data using a simple function. The function generates an array of 30 values from a seed (a value 0-9). Then, a random decimal is added to each value. The indicies of the values are also offset to introduce randomness. This ideally simulates data.
